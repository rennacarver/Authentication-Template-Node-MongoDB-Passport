## Features

- skeleton for building full stack apps using Node, Express, MongoDB, and Passport

## How It's Made:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, EJS

## Lessons Learned:

- Codebases change quickly and templates from a year ago are often no longer functional

- Password and email validation is missing
- Password reset
